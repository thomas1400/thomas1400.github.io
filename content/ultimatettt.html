        This Java-driven Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game was a fun exercise in 2D graphics, object-oriented game design, and AI implementation. The motivation for this project came from a fun class I took in Spring 2019, Comp Sci 270: Intro to Artificial Intelligence. One unit of that class was focused on AI for two-player, zero-sum games, like checkers, chess, or Go. I'd always loved the game of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (it's like tic-tac-toe, but recursive: every board contains a second, smaller board. The object of the game is to win three small boards in a row; it makes for a much more interesting and strategic game!), so I thought I'd apply what I'd learned in that class to it!
        <br> <br>
        I started by designing the game itself. My object-oriented implementation involves a series of 'nested' classes: for example, the large, main board (the MainBoard class) contains an array of nine smaller, sub-boards (the CellBoard class). The sub-boards, in turn, contain an array of nine cells (the Cell class). Managing these classes and their complex interactions taught me a lot about variable scope and management, and improved my understanding of object-oriented design. You can see the result of this work below: I successfully constructed a working, two-player game!

        My next goal was to add the one-player option: playing against an AI. After reading several research papers on the performance of various AI algorithms on this game, I decided that minimax search with alpha-beta pruning was the way to go. Minimax is an algorithm for two-player, zero-sum games that recursively searches through all possible game states, up to a limited depth, to find the optimal move for a player to make. Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization on this algorithm that limits the search space by ruling out, or 'pruning', moves that are absolutely worse or will never be made.
        <br><br>
        Implementing this algorithm was a challenge, but a fun one! It took many hours of troubleshooting to work out all of the bugs, but it was well worth it for the satisfying conclusion. Now, I can practice my Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe skills against a very impressive AI opponent.

        You can try it out too! Take a look at the rules <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/" target="_blank">here</a> and download the standalone .jar executable below! Note that it requires JDK 7+ to run, but has no other dependencies. Have fun!
