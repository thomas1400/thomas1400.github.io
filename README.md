# Dev Portfolio

This repo contains my personal portfolio, created with Sass and JavaScript and based on work from [Ryan Fitzgerald](https://www.github.com/ryanfitzgerald/devportfolio/). With his template as a starting point, I made style and content changes to adapt it for my own uses. Now, it highlights my education, experience, and current projects! Check it out to learn more about my interests and skills.
